# Sumac
*Sumac* is a language agnostic protocol that facilitates object based communication between any two computer programs.

## Implementations
* Ruby: [ruby-sumac](https://github.com/robfors/ruby-sumac)

## Why Sumac Was Made
Let's start by imagining we were tasked with developing a project where one program needed to communicate with another program. Think in very universal terms. These programs could simply be separated by process, or they could be on physically separated on two computers on opposite sides of the planet. Further, we also may be restricted to certain communication mediums. If we were building a dynamic website in JavaScript that needed to query a web server running our favourite language, historically we would be restricted to sending HTTP requests, but now a days we could take advantage of WebSockets. If we needed to send commands to an Arduino project we may need to communicate over a serial connection. For some projects we have more freedom and can open raw TCP sockets. In all of these examples we would typically assume a client server model, with one program will listening for connections, and the other with trying to initiate them.

If we were to design any of these projects we would typically need to build a communication layer consisting of three general components: a representation of the data we want to send, in a format that can be sent over the medium available; a layer in our client to convert our data to the new formant and send over the medium; and a layer in our server to convert what is incoming from the medium, back into the original data being sent. Further, if our application needs duplex communication we will need to add additional functionality to each layer. As you can probably see, a significant problem with this traditional approach is that designing our own communication layer is a time consuming process. We may also find ourselves redesigning one each time we start a new project that has different constraints, communicates over a different medium or simply requires a different programming language.

Letâ€™s consider what we would have ultimately built after all this effort. We should be able to assume that an object oriented language is often being used for each end of the communication, or at the very least, the data being sent can, or already is represented in objects. If we consider these assumptions, all we are building is a layer that takes objects from one object oriented program, converts them to a new format, sends them over a medium, then converts them back into the exact same objects on a different object oriented program. On a high level this whole procedure sounds kind of redundant and repetitive, doesn't it? Wouldn't it make sense if we could simply rely on the same protocol to facilitate communication of data for the majority of our modern day projects? This was the problem *Sumac* was made to solve.

## Design Objectives
*Sumac* was designed with a few important criteria and constraints.
* language agnostic: It must be able to be implemented on many different languages, allowing them all to communicate effortlessly.
* secure: Any implementation must enforce proper security practices such that it will be safe to use as a public facing API.
* support common language features: It should support common features found in many leagues.
* simplicity: It should be simple as possible so it can be implemented and run on many devices. For very low resource devices such as microcontrollers, it is acceptable to limit some the protocol's functionality so long as any request for unavailable features can be handled gracefully by the remote end point.

## Alternative Solutions
*Sumac* was obviously not the first project to attempt to solve the problem we were trying to solve, however, it's objectives do differ enough to justify a new protocol.
